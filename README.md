Hello, Zahin Ukasyah here!

I'm 20 years old and a first year student studying software engineering at Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM).
I'm currently developing a solid foundation in computer science concepts and programming languages as a student studying software engineering, as well as expertise in software development techniques and tools. I'm also picking up knowledge about cooperation, software testing, and debugging. I'm excited to put my knowledge and abilities to use on practical projects and help create cutting-edge software solutions!
